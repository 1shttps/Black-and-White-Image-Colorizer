# Black-and-White-Image-Colorizer
The provided Python script utilizes pre-trained models for colorization, specifically ECCV 2016 and SIGGRAPH 2017, through argparse for user-defined inputs. By processing an input image, it generates and displays the original, grayscale, and colorized versions side by side, saving the outputs as ECCV16 and SIGGRAPH17 PNG files
